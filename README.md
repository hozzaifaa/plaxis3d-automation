# plaxis3d-automation

A collection of Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks for automating geotechnical modeling and analysis using PLAXIS 3D.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to use the PLAXIS 3D Python API to:

- Automate model creation and geometry definition  
- Assign soil materials and boundary conditions  
- Generate meshes  
- Run staged construction analyses  
- Extract and process results  

## Requirements

- PLAXIS 3D with scripting license  
- Python 3.7+  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- `plxscripting` (included with PLAXIS installation)  
- Additional Python packages (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`)

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plaxis3d-automation.git
cd plaxis3d-automation
````

### Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open and run the notebooks to explore automation workflows.
